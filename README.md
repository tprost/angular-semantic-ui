Angular module for creating or manipulating modals. It uses `semantic-ui` HTML markup, but otherwise is basically exactly like `github.com/Pathgather/popeye`.

Let's use this style guide: https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide

## Dimmer

### TODO

write controller for `dimmable`

## Modal

### TODO

* `onDeny` and `onApprove` callbacks with corresponding buttons
* make modal created with `modalService` not break if you use its controller
* more tests
* option to use margins to center modal (on by default)
* modal settings
* DOM settings
* callbacks maybe
